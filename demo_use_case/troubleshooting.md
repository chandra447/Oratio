# AuraLight Smart Bulb Troubleshooting Guide

## Topic: Wi-Fi Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Bulb does not appear in the Aura Tech app.
- App shows "Connection Failed" error.
- Bulb is on, but unresponsive to app commands.

**Resolution Steps:**
1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure the user's smartphone has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled. The app uses Bluetooth for the initial setup handshake.
2.  **Check Router:** Confirm the home Wi-Fi is a 2.4GHz network. AuraLight bulbs do not support 5GHz networks for setup. Most routers are dual-band, so this is a common point of failure.
3.  **Power Cycle:** Turn the light bulb off at the physical switch. Wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This often resolves simple connectivity glitches.
4.  **Enter Pairing Mode:** After power-cycling, the bulb should automatically start pulsing with a blue light. This indicates it is in pairing mode. If it's not, turn the bulb on and off 3 times in a row to manually trigger pairing mode.
5.  **App Process:** In the Aura Tech app, tap "Add New Device" and select the AuraLight bulb. Follow the on-screen instructions. The app should now detect the pulsing bulb.
6.  **Final Check:** Once the app confirms success, the bulb's light will turn solid white. Test the connection by turning it off and on within the app.
