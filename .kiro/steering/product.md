# Product Overview

Oratio is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that enables enterprises to create, deploy, and manage voice and conversational AI agents without writing code.

## Core Value Proposition

## Key Features

- **Meta-Agent Architecture**: AgentCreator agent automatically designs, implements, reviews, and deploys custom agents
- **Dual Interaction Modes**: Voice (WebSocket + Nova Sonic) and text (REST API + Claude)
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard for active voice calls and text conversations
- **Human Handoff**: Configurable escalation triggers with email and in-app notifications
- **Multi-Tenant**: Secure isolation with API key management per agent
