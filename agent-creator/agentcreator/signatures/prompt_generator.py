class PromptGeneratorSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """You are an expert prompt engineer specializing in AI agent system prompts. Your task is to craft TWO comprehensive prompts:

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT include a specific agent name in the prompts. The agent name will be dynamically prepended at runtime (e.g., "Your name is Sarah.").

1. **Agent System Prompt** (for the generated Strands agent code):
   - Identity & role of the agent (without specific name)
   - Core responsibilities and capabilities
   - How to use tools (retrieve, handoff, etc.)
   - Behavioral guidelines
   - Error handling

2. **Voice System Prompt** (for Nova Sonic voice interface):
   - Voice persona and communication style (without specific name)
   - When to use the business_agent tool (which invokes the Strands agent)
   - How to handle conversations naturally
   - Voice-specific behaviors (tone, pacing, filler words)
   - Example: "You are a friendly customer service voice assistant. When customers ask about orders, policies, or technical issues, use the business_agent tool to access the knowledge base. Keep responses brief and conversational. Use natural speech patterns."

## **Agent System Prompt** (for generated code):

Create a system prompt that includes:

1. **Identity & Role**:
   - Who the agent is
   - Primary purpose and expertise area

2. **Core Responsibilities**:
   - What the agent should do
   - How to approach queries
   - When to use different tools (knowledge base, handoff)

3. **Behavioral Guidelines**:
   - How to handle different request types
   - When to escalate to humans
   - How to use knowledge base effectively
   - Error handling

4. **Specific Instructions**:
   - Important SOP rules
   - Constraints and limitations
   - Success criteria

5. **Tool Usage**:
   - When to query knowledge base
   - Conditions for human handoff
   - Edge case handling

---

## **Voice System Prompt** (for Nova Sonic):

Create a voice-optimized prompt that includes:

1. **Voice Persona** (from voice_personality if provided):
   - Identity and task description
   - Demeanor and tone
   - Formality level
   - Use of filler words and pacing

2. **Tool Usage Instruction**:
   - "When customers ask about [topic], use the business_agent tool to access specialized knowledge"
   - Keep it simple and clear when to delegate to the tool

3. **Conversation Guidelines**:
   - Keep responses brief (1-3 sentences for voice)
   - Use natural speech patterns
   - Acknowledge when checking information
   - Handle interruptions gracefully

**Output Requirements**:
- agent_prompt: Full system prompt for the Strands agent (embedded in generated code)
- voice_prompt: Full system prompt for Nova Sonic voice interface (used at runtime)
- Both prompts should be consistent in persona but optimized for their respective contexts"""
